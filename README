DBD::Unify --  an Unify interface for Perl 5 using DBI.

This is the Database Driver for the Unify family of database products.

It has been ported and tested on DataServer 6.3AB, but this does not
mean it might not work on U2000 databases.

It uses DBI 1.13 and perl5.00503, but will probably work with DBI 0.93
or higher and perl 5.004 or higher.

This is a very basic port for Unify. At the moment of writing, this DBD
only supports one singe statement handle at the same time. This has to be
fixed, but The E/SQL syntax of unify does not support variable cursor names,
so it probably has to be a fixed set of routines dealing with separate
arbitrary maximum number of name sets.

DATE, TIME, TEXT and BINARY fields are not (yet) supported, though it is
easy to change (code is supplied, but returns undef). Since we do not use
these types with our databases, it's up to you to supply patches.

BUILDING, TESTING AND INSTALLING:

    This will only work if DBI is installed on a recent version of perl ;-)

	   # perl Makefile.PL
	   # make test
	   # make install

    Make test will use the current database and create a table "xx". If
    the test fails, table xx might still exist. If it already exists,
    it might get lost, so be aware!

    As with all modules: Patches are welcome.

RESTRICTIONS:

    # No documentation (yet)

    # Only 1 (one) statement handler at the time

    # Missing support for datatypes DATE, TIME, TEXT and BINARY in fetch

    # Database attributes not (yet) implemented. (AutoCommit et all)

    # Statement attributes not (yet) implemented.

    # Row counts not (yet) implemented.

    # Unify only distributes static libraries, so the module might
      become rather big

TO DO:

    # Remove as many restrictions as possible ;-)
