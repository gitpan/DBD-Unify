*** Release 0.08

    Mon 19 May 2000 <h.m.brand@hccnet.nl>

	- Described output (DBIc_NUM_FIELDS (imp_sth)) and input
	  (DBIc_NUM_PARAMS (imp_sth)) seperately, so the {NAME} attribute
	  is now also supported for OSF/1
	- Repaired ID allocation if exceeded default maximum of 32
	- Added test for ID allocation

*** Release 0.07

    Wed 03 May 2000 <h.m.brand@hccnet.nl>

	- Added imp_dbh.id to allow multiple DB handles on same DB preventing
	  conflicts with dynamic naming.
	  Multiple different Unify DB's is not (yet) supported by the Unify
	  E/SQL environment. :-((
	- Stringified REAL, FLOAT and (HUGE) AMOUNT values on fetch, but still
	  preserving the numeric context (it's an SvNV alright).
	- Updated pod sections in Unify.pm

*** Release 0.06

    Wed 05 Apr 2000 <h.m.brand@hccnet.nl>

	- Saved field descriptor data to implement correct return values of
	  $sth->fetchrow_hashref () calls
	- Test now realy CHECKS what happened, not only spits out what I
	  would recognize as succeeded test output. I still rely on RaiseError
	  to crash the test on DB failures.

*** Release 0.05

    Thu 23 Mar 2000 <h.m.brand@hccnet.nl>

	- Recognize strings w/ negative numbers in bind where !SvIOK (value)
	  In fact drop the SvIOK () check alltogether and let SvIV () do the
	  job, including the warnings. I still want to be able to check the
	  value BEFORE the warning, but we'll see ...
	- Index display in bind failure
